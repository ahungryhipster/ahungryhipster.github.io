Hey Jenny,

Drag and drop any image you want to be featured here. Technically you can drag and drop anywhere, but if you leave it in one place it'll be easier later on. 
Once you've drag and dropped, copy the file name because we'll be needing it for the metadata in your article. 
Steps:
1. Go to your article
2. Open the Meta Data box
3. Go to Featured Images
4. Type in "feature: filename.jpg". If your file extension is anything other than .jpg, just replace it with whatever it is.
5. Commit and you're done!![photo-5.JPG](/images/photo-5.JPG)
