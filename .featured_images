In order to upload the pictures to be feature (big o' background picture behind your logo), you have to drag and drop them from your Mac into this file (technically any file, but keeping everything in one place will make things easier later). Copy the name of the image, because we'll need it later. 

Then, the next step is to go to the _posts folder and create your new post by clicking the "New File". You'll have to manual enter/paste the name of the image you want to be featured in the "Featured Image" box in the Meta Tags option (on the right hand side of the screen).
