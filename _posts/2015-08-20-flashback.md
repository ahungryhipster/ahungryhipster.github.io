## A New Post

Moving to a new city is difficult. Moving to a new city that is a 5 hour flight away from home is even more difficult. 

This upcoming Friday, I'll be going home to visit my parents. They've been through a lot already this year: taking care of my grandmother more since my grandfather passed, and my neice was recently diagnosed with Leukemia. So, I'm surprising my mom and hopefully brightening up my parents weekend while also enjoying all the new spots in Nashville. 

With that being said, I just wanted to highlight my old favorite spots in Nashville. 

Hopefully, I'll find some new favorites, and if anyone has a recommendation, please tell!
