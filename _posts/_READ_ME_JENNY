Hi baby,

Here's the instructions on how to use this site to edit your blog.

1. Create a "New File"
2. Edit the title. 
3. Edit the body however you see fit.
4. Edit the Meta Data. Note, if you don't want a featured image, just leave it blank. More below.
5. Save and commit, it'll automatically be drafted the first time you save. In order to actually publish it you have to go back, reopen the file, then click the Unpublished button.

**Meta Data**

Tag
This will be the place you enter keywords about your article. Remember to separate with commas!


Desciption
A short description about your article. It'll appear in things like Twitter Cards, when other people link your site. It could just be the first sentence of your article, you can then add dots ...


Featured Images
First, drag and drop any image you want to be featured inside your article. Make sure it's less than 1MB, or less it'll be a pain and clog up everything.
After you're done, it should look something like this once it's uploaded: 

![photo.JPG](/images/photo.JPG)

Once you've drag and dropped, copy the file name because we'll be needing it for the metadata in your article, then delete the code.

Then: 
	1. Go to your article
	2. Open the Meta Data box
	3. Go to Featured Images
	4. Type in "feature: photo.jpg". If your file extension is 			anything other than .jpg, just replace it with whatever it is.
	5. Commit and make sure the featured image is there like this: 

		image:
			feature: photo.jpg

	NOT -> image: null 
		(that means there's no featured image)

	The trick is to unpublish it, then add the metadata, then click 	publish again, then commit.

6. Enjoy!
