I am a huge fan of the Goldbergs and the places they've created for Strategic Hospitality. If you're unfamiliar with the group, two of their most popular projects include Patterson House and the Catbird Seat. So, once I heard the brothers were working on a new project, I've kept my eye on Pinewood Social since. 

Pinewood Social is referred to as a "place to meet." It's designed so that you can spend your whole day there. From grabbing a cup of coffee in the morning, to working remotely on your laptop at one of their community tables, to eating dinner with your friends to only grab drinks after, this place is catered for your every need. They're currently working on a bowling alley, karaoke rooms, and an outdoor swimming pool.

I visited their second day of operation. Although I still had to wait with my 8:30PM reservation, the staff was very courteous and directed us to the cozy waiting area with water and menus. 

##FOOD

The menu was created by Josh Habiger who previously worked at Catbird Seat and before that, Alinea (repeatedly named one of the best restaurants in North America). I was excited to say the least. 

We started off with shrimp cocktail which was incredibly fresh.

and we continued on with the fried chicken and pork chop. I really wanted to try the mushroom pot pie but unfortunately they sold out. I was disappointed but all the reason to return!

The sp√§tzle with the pork chop was excellent. 

##DRINK

There is a wide variety of drinks from wines, beers, and cocktails. The bar is ran by Matt Tocco, who previously worked at Patterson House and then Rolf & Daughters, so, have high expectations. 

I had the Lemon of Pink and John had the Sidecar Named Doug, pictured below.

The ice for each cocktail is hand chiseled, so take the time to sit by the bar and watch your bartenders create something unique for you. 

In addition, they have a coffee bar that was created with local neighbor, Crema Coffee. They offer all standard coffee and espresso drinks but have coffee cocktails to come! 

##ALWAYS LEAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT

Pinewood Social currently only serves two desserts: apple pie and pear (custard) pie. They haven't started serving these pies with ice cream but they will be soon!

##SERVICE

We all know that service really makes or breaks the experience. We had wonderful service tonight thanks to Chris G. who was working over a 12 hour shift and still made sure we had a great time. If you look closely, all of the males are wearing ties with Pinewood's logo on it and they have custom laces for their shoes :)

##ENTERTAINMENT

The bowling lanes, karaoke rooms, and swimming pool haven't been finished yet. You can see the bowling lanes currently being constructed and they look fantastic. They've used reclaimed wood and it gives off a very "vintage" feel. In addition, there are no ball and shoe rental fees. YUP!

All in all, I'm still very excited to see what the rest of Pinewood Social will develop into. There is no doubt that this gathering place will be successful, just like any of the other Goldbergs' projects. Take the time to check it out. It's in one of the Trolley Barns right next to Emma and the Entrepreneur Center. The hours are M-F 7AM-1AM and Sat/Sun 9AM-1AM. 

P.S. Make a reservation. John and I got a private room in the back of the place with a booth and TV in it. We weren't expecting it but it was a pleasant surprise!
