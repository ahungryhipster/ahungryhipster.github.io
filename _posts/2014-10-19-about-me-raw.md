## A New Post

We've all got a story, here's mine:

I'm a first generation American born Korean American and a first generation college graduate; these two fact about me have shaped me in every way possible. 

I'm not your stereotypical, overachieving Asian. I've got a slightly different story. 

My parents immigrated to the US in their twenties, facing signficant cultural and language barriers. This ultimately forced them into manual labor jobs that allowed me to grow up in a very humble home. But, I was fortunate enough to go to a public magnet school in Nashville, Hume Fogg, where I realized I didn't have the same opportunities as my peers. 

My parents were always strapped for money and time. Both of my parents worked and still work at least ten hours a day. This limited my opportunities for financial reasons and because no one could take me to be a part of something. I didn't want money to be a barrier between me and my peers so I took it upon myself to be responsible for my future. When I turned fifteen, I got my first job working for the Metropolitan Public Health Center in Nashville and I've worked continuously since then. Not because I had to, but because I didn't want anything in my way. 

I've had 17 jobs by the age of 22.
