Sometimes, I forget that this is _my_ blog and that I can write about whatever I want. My type A tendencies make me feel like I have to stick to one type of content or material but I think it's time to start blogging more about the things I want to instead of just food. Hopefully I'll start posting regularly, since I haven't been lately!
