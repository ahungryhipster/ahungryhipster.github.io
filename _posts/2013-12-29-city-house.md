In light of the recent giving season, I wanted to highlight an individual that has continuously given to me and John: Andrew Wilkins. We met Andrew the first time I took John to City House. We walked in, asked for a table, and that was it. He didn't write down our name or number, and then we realized he was memorizing the order of all the people that were waiting. We made sure to compliment him and that was ultimately the beginning of our friendship with Andrew and our constant inclination to visit City House because of the wonderful staff.

##DRINK
Order a drink from Alisa. She is a _phenomenal_ bartender who knows the menu very well; you can't go wrong with any of her food or drink suggestions. She has a side project which includes vintage clothing and if you get on her good side, she might also share some of her favorite fashion spots in Nashville :)

My go to drink is the Moose but pictured is the Solomon. 

##FOOD
John frequently orders the Springer Mountain Half Chicken and it is very consistent. The chicken itself is always tender and juicy, which complements the crispy skin. The salsa verde and calabrian chiles served with the dish gives it a zesty spice that leaves you wanting more. It's a pretty safe choice, nothing too out of the ordinary.

I've ordered 2 of the pasta dishes at City House and I wouldn't order either again. The Bread Gnocchi isn't the typical, soft, tender, creamy gnocchi dish that I usually expect. It's on the tougher side and served with a lot less sauce to fully compliment the tougher consistency of the potato dumplings. 

The second pasta dish I've had is the Fettuccini with Lamb. I enjoyed the simplicity of the dish but some of the pasta noodles were stuck together and for me, that's a deal breaker.

On the other hand, I love the pizza at City House. I've had the Lamb Sausage, which isn't always on the menu, and the Belly Ham pizza. The mozzarella on the pizza is perfect. Honestly, I'd prefer the Belly Ham pizza over the pizzas at Ca'Momi which is an Italian restaurant I recently visited in Napa even though it has a Michelin star.

If you enjoy red meat, order the Painted Hills Tri Tip. It's a very tender meat full of flavor, especially with the red onions which fully enhances the overall taste of the dish.

##ALWAYS LEAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT
Two things make me come back to City House: the people and the dessert. Ever since I've had the Chocolate Stout & Espresso Ice Box Cake, I haven't been able to stray away from it. The toffee brittle crumbs, caramel, and vanilla gelato that accompany it makes it a dessert you will be craving. Order it, you won't regret it. 

Every single time, Andrew takes care of the dessert John & I order. We hate/love that he does it but it has begun the war of never ending gifts. He buys us dessert, we buy him bourbon. He's is a wonderful person and is the main reason why we love going to City House.
