In light of the recent giving season, I wanted to highlight an individual that has continuously given to me and John: Andrew Wilkins. We met Andrew the first time I took John to City House and at the time he was working as a host. We walked in, asked for a table, and that was it. We were pretty impressed that Andrew didn't write down our name or how many was in our party, and as a result remembered the order of all the people that were waiting. We made sure to compliment him and that was ultimately the beginning of our friendship with Andrew and our constant inclination to visit City House because of the wonderful staff.

##DRINK
Order a drink from Alisa. She is a _phenomenal_ bartender who knows the menu very well; you can't go wrong with any of her food or drink suggestions. She has a side project which includes vintage clothing and if you get on her good side, she might also share some of her favorite fashion spots in Nashville!

My go to drink is the Moose but pictured is the Solomon. 

##FOOD
John frequently orders the Springer Mountain Half Chicken and it is very consistent. The chicken itself is always tender and juicy. THe salsa verde and calabrian chiles served with the dish gives it a zesty spice which makes you want to eat more.
