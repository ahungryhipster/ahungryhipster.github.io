Hopefully you've heard of Max and Ben Goldberg by now, the co-owners of Strategic Hospitality. These two grew up in Nashville and have continuously done an excellent job identifying what the city is lacking. They've filled these gaps with their projects including Patterson House, Catbird Seat, and now Pinewood Social. 

Pinewood Social is referred to as a "place to meet" and it's designed so that you could spend your whole day there. From grabbing a cup of Crema coffee at 7AM and working at one of the community tables to eating dinner and watching the bartenders chisel ice for each cocktail at 12AM, this place is catered for your every need. They're currently still constructing the bowling alley, karaoke rooms, and an outdoor swimming pool.

I visited the second day of operation and it was _busy_. 

##FOOD

The menu was created by Josh Habiger who was previously co-chef at the Catbird Seat and Alinea. If you're unfamiliar with Alinea, it's a restaurant in Chicago that has been internationally recognized by the Michelin Food Guide and repeatedly referred to as the best restaurant in North America. You can expect to have a fantastic meal if you hear the name Josh Habiger. 

John and I started off with the Shrimp Cocktail and I really enjoyed it. The shrimp was very fresh, especially for being served in Nashville.

We continued on with the Fried Chicken and the Pork Chop. I had initially ordered the Mushroom Pot Pie but they sold out... I guess that's all the reason to make a trip back.
