In light of the snow on Monday and feeling under the weather, I thought I should write about one of my favorite meals to eat when it's cold outside or when I'm sick... I used to eat pho religiously. After church, every Sunday, my best friend and I would always grab a bowl of pho so I've been to _a LOT_ of pho restaurants in Nashville including Miss Saigon, Kien Giang, King's Market, Vinh-Long, Hieu Giang, Thai Papaya, and [Far East Nashville](http://www.fareastnashville.com). Far East is definitely my first preference, not only because of the pho, but because you can't really go wrong with any of their other dishes either. 

##DRINK
I recently tried the Thai Tea bubble tea; they only have Thai Tea, Green Tea, and Black Tea.

I wouldn't recommend ordering the bubble tea. The flavor was too diluted by the ice used to make the bubble tea. Although, I will say the tapioca balls were more fresh than I thought they would be. 

##PHO
I love pho, I really do. I would be more than willing to eat pho with you about 98% of the time. The pho at Far East is very savory **and** light, which is very rare.

 Most of the phos I've had in Nashville have this lingering taste of MSG that just makes you feel awful after you eat it, but not at Far East.
