In light of the snow on Monday and feeling under the weather, I thought I should write about one of my favorite meals to eat when it's cold outside or when I'm sick... pho. I used to eat pho religiously. After church, every Sunday, my best friend and I would always grab a bowl of pho so I've been to _a LOT_ of pho restaurants in Nashville including Miss Saigon, Kien Giang, King's Market, Vinh-Long, Hieu Giang, Thai Papaya, and Far East. Far east is definitely my first choice.
