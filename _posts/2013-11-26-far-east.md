In light of the snow on Monday and feeling under the weather, I thought I should write about one of my favorite meals to eat when it's cold outside or when I'm sick... pho. Every Sunday, after church, my best friend and I used to always grab a bowl of pho so I've been to _a lot_ of Vietnamese restaurants in Nashville including Miss Saigon, Kien Giang, King's Market, Vinh-Long, Hieu Giang, Thai Papaya, and [Far East Nashville](http://www.fareastnashville.com). Far East is definitely my first preference, not only because of the pho, but because you can't really go wrong with any of their other dishes either. 


##DRINK
I recently tried their Thai Tea bubble tea; they only have Thai Tea, Green Tea, and Black Tea.

I wouldn't recommend ordering the bubble tea. The flavor was too diluted by the ice used to make the drink. Although, I will say the tapioca was a lot more fresh than I thought it would be.

##PHO
I love pho, I really do. I would be more than willing to eat pho with you about 98% of the time. If you aren't familiar with what pho is, it's a Vietnamese soup made with chicken or beef broth. It includes rice noodles, a variety of spices and it comes with a plate of basil, bean sprouts, jalapenos, and a lime that you add to your discretion. The pho at Far East is very savory **and** light, which is rare.

The noodles are thinner, and the meat is better quality. Most of the phos I've had in Nashville have this lingering taste of MSG in their broth that just makes you feel awful after you eat it, but not at Far East. 

##OTHER DISHES
Every single time John and I go to Far East, we order the fried rice in addition to the pho.

The fried rice has beef, chicken, and shrimp in it and Far East just gets it right. It's as simple as that. If you like spicy food, don't forget to add Sriracha to your fried rice :)

We've also had the Cary Ga Vietnamese Coconut Curry Chicken and the Bo Luc Lac Shakey Beef. I don't like coconut but you could barely taste in the curry. Both dishes were great, I just don't think I can stray away from my default order of pho and fried rice. 

##WHAT TO GET

1. Pho
2. Fried Rice 
3. Use Sriracha
