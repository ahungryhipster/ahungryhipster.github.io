## Favorite place to grab a cup of joe

**7AM: JJ's**, it's desolate, quaint, and the comfy couches make it so easy to settle in. Parking isn't usually an issue at that time, which is _rare_ for JJs.

Tip: if there's no spot in front, park in the Noshville lot behind, I've never gotten ticketed (shh!). 


**2PM: Barista Parlor**, weekends are always busy. But if you go at odd hours, you can always find a spot without feeling suffocated. Treat yourself, get a macaroon.

Tip: Don't come here if you need an outlet. 


**6PM: Crema**, parking can be a hurdle, but it is worth it. It's the original, classic Nashville coffee shop, enough said. 

Tip: Don't feel like dealing with parking? Go to Pinewood Social and visit their extension of Crema. 

**12AM: Pinewood Social**, still craving some coffee? Pinewood Social closes at 1AM and the coffee bar is always open during hours of operations.

Tip: Don't expect to get work done here. The community table is great but the ambiance of the place won't let you be as productive as you hope for. 

**Honorable Mention: Frothy Monkey**, oh I love this place. But the constant crowds make it always difficult to find a table with outlet and be productive. However, f you only need to pick something up _and_ have some time to spare, Frothy Monkey is a great option. 

TIP: Google Fiber at Starbucks? WHAT? Apparently in 2013, Starbucks ended their relationship with AT&T and partnered with Google to enhance their wifi. Well, it was _rumoured_ to me that one of the Starbucks on West End has it. Google Fiber in Nashville? Yes, please. We all know [Comcast is literally the worst](http://consumerist.com/2014/04/08/congratulations-to-comcast-your-2014-worst-company-in-america/).

Hope this was helpful. Any feedback is welcomed!
