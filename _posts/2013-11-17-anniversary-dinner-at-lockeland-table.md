Yesterday, John and I celebrated our one year anniversary at [Lockeland Table](http://lockelandtable.com). We had never been before, but we realized it was finally time for a visit. The runner ups were 404 Kitchen and the Farm House...Ultimately, we made a great decision. 

##COURSE 1
I had previously tweeted at @[clarkmatclark](https://twitter.com/clarkmatclark), "pizza ninja" at Lockeland Table, for recommendations and he recommended the chicken liver pat√®; I've read great reviews for this dish multiple times but John insisted we get the Cox Farms Roasted Bone Marrow.

I was _really_ resistant to eating the bone marrow because of its jelly like consistency, but I have to admit it tasted great. John absolutely loved it. However, I'd only recommend it if you enjoy that type of consistency.

##COURSE 2

We ordered the grilled Hereford NY strip with chimichurri and it was cooked to perfection. Lockeland Table is one of the very few restaurants that gets medium-rare right. The chimichurri was a great addition to the dish that demonstrated to be very smoky and savory itself.

We also ordered the Potato & Taragon Gnocchi. It was definitely a unique gnocchi dish, mostly because of its house made boursin cream sauce. I enjoyed it a lot, but don't expect your standard Italian gnocchi. The Tennshootoe (salted ham) was a great touch, but all in all the dish ended to be a little too salty for me.

##ALWAYS LEAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT

It was our anniversary so of course we splurged a little...

We ordered the Banana Foster Bread Pudding and the very popular Olive & Sinclair Chocolate Chip Skillet.

The rum was actually prevalent in the banana pudding. It was excellent, but next time I would only order the chocolate chip skillet.

Honestly, I'm just a sucker for any type of dessert that serves something warm with ice cream. 


If you love Lockeland Table, consider the 5 course pop up dinner the "pizza ninja", Matthew Clark, and [Zach Maddox](https://twitter.com/longhaul78) from [Coffee, Lunch](http://www.coffeelunchnashville.com) are hosting this upcoming Sunday. $80/person and it's BYOB :) 

If you haven't been to Lockeland Table yet and you want to go on the weekend, make a reservation. The restaurant holds about 88 people and it gets pretty busy. Honestly, we didn't have the privacy we really wanted for our anniversary but the experience made up for it.
