Yesterday, John and I celebrated our one year anniversary at [Lockeland Table](http://lockelandtable.com). We had never been before, but we realized it was finally time for a visit after debating between Lockeland Table, 404 Kitchen, and the Farm House...Ultimately, we made a great decision. 

##Course 1
I had previously tweeted at @clarkatclark, "pizza ninja" at Lockeland Table, for recommendations and he recommended the chicken liver pat√®; I've read great reviews for this dish multiple times but John insisted we get the Cox Farms Roasted Bone Marrow.

I was really resistant to eating the bone marrow because of its jelly like consistency, but I have to admit it tasted great. John absolutely loved it. However, I'd only recommend it if you enjoy that type of consistency.

##Course 2

We ordered the grilled Hereford NY strip with chimichurri and it was cooked to perfection. Lockeland Table is one of the very few restaurants that gets medium-rare right. The chimichurri was a great addition to the dish that demonstrated to be very smoky and savory in itself.

We also ordered the Potato & Taragon Gnocchi which proved to be very unique relative to other gnocchi dishes, mostly because of its house made boursin cream sauce. I enjoyed it a lot but don't expect your standard Italian gnocchi dish. The Tennshootoe (salted ham) was a great touch to the dish but all in all it ended to be a little too concentrated in taste/salty for me.

##Always leave room for dessert

It was our anniversary so of course we splurged a little...

We ordered the Banana Foster Bread Pudding and the very popular Olive & Sinclair Chocolate Chip Skillet.

Although we didn't have the privacy we wanted, we enjoyed our dinner very much.
