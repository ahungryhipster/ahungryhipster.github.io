Yesterday, John and I celebrated our one year anniversary at [Lockeland Table](http://lockelandtable.com). We had never been before but realized it was finally time for us to visit after debating between Lockeland Table, 404 Kitchen, and the Farm House...We made a great decision. 

##Course 1
I had previously tweeted at @clarkatclark, "pizza ninja" at Lockeland Table, and he recommended the chicken liver pat√®; I've read great reviews for this dish multiple times but John insisted we get the Cox Farms Roasted Bone Marrow.

I was really resistant to eating the bone marrow because of its jelly like consistency, but I have to admit it tasted great. John absolutely loved it. However, I'd only recommend it if you enjoy that type of texture. 

##Course 2

We ordered the grilled Hereford NY strip with chimichurri, and it was cooked to perfection. It is one of the very few restaurants that gets medium-rare right. The chimichurri was a great addition to the dish that demonstrated to be very smoky and savory.

We also ordered the Potato & Taragon Gnocchi which proved to be very unique relative to other gnocchi dishes, mostly because of its house made,creamy boursin cream sauce. I enjoyed it a lot but don't expect your standard Italian gnocchi dish. The Tennshootoe (salted ham) was a great touch to the dish but all in all the dish ended to be a little too concentrated in taste for me.

Although we didn't have the privacy we wanted, we enjoyed our dinner very much.
