Yesterday, John and I celebrated our one year anniversary at [Lockeland Table](http://lockelandtable.com). We had never been before but realized it was finally time for us to visit after debating between Lockeland Table, 404 Kitchen, and the Farm House...We made a great decision. 

##Course 1
I had previously tweeted at @clarkatclark, "pizza ninja" at Lockeland Table, and he recommended the chicken liver pat√®; I've read great reviews for this dish multiple times but John insisted we get the Cox Farms roasted bone marrow.

If you love Lockeland Table, consider the pop up dinner one of the chefs, Chris Mat Clark, and ___ from Coffee, Lunch are hosting 

Although we didn't have the privacy we wanted, we enjoyed our dinner very much. 
Make a reservation. Please.
