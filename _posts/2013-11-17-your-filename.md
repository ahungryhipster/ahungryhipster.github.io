Happy one year anniversary, love!

Thank you so much for making me this blog. Your abilities, creativity, and potential never cease to amaze me. You are such a talented individual and I truly admire you. 

More so, thank you for loving me unconditionally and showing me what love is. You are my best friend and the love of my life. I can't imagine a life without you, and I hope I won't have to. I love you.
