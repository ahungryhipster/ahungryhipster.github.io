One of my best friends is of Cuban descent and last summer he suggested going to Back to Cuba, a restaurant him and his dad would frequently visit. The owner is also of Cuban descent and he grew up in Miami, an area that has an abundance of Cuban restaurants. The owner took the time to talk to us and share his story-- all while feeding us free dessert. I had never had Cuban food before Back to Cuba but I loved it, and I've been going back every since...

I _always_ get a fruit milkshake. I can't just not get one, I would be doing wrong to myself.

They're incredibly milky and creamy and I've just never had anything similar to it. I always get mango or passionfruit; either is excellent. If you only get one of the things I recommend, please get a fruit milkshake.
