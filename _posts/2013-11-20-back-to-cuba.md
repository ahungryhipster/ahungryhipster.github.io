One of my best friends is of Cuban descent and last summer he suggested going to Back to Cuba, a restaurant him and his dad would frequently visit. I had never had Cuban food before but I loved it, and I've been going back ever since. 

The owner of Back to Cuba is also of Cuban descent. He grew up in Miami and I loved that he took the time to talk to us and share his story-- all while feeding us free dessert.
