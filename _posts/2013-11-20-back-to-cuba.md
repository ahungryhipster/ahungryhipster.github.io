One of my best friends is of Cuban descent and last summer he suggested going to [Back to Cuba](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Back-to-Cuba-Cafe/105542942857719), a restaurant him and his dad would frequently visit. The owner is also of Cuban descent and I appreciated that he took the time to talk to us and share his story-- all while feeding us free dessert. I had never had Cuban food before Back to Cuba but I loved it, and I've been going back ever since...

##DRINK

I _always_ get a fruit milkshake. I can't just not get one.

They're incredibly creamy and I've just never had anything similar to it. I always get mango or passionfruit; either is excellent. If you only get one of the things I recommend, please just get a fruit milkshake.

##FOOD

I'm a fan of the steak dishes here. I usually order the Bisteck Palomilla which is just Palomilla Steak, a thinly sliced steak cooked with lime juice, garlic, and onions or the Churrasco which is skirt steak with Chimichurri sauce. If you've read my post about [Lockeland Table](http://www.ahungryhipster.com/articles/anniversary-dinner-at-lockeland-table/), then you know that John and I are big fans of Chimichurri sauce. It's a sauce used with grilled meat that contains parsley, garlic, vinegar, and chili pepper flakes. The Churrasco with rice, beans, and tostones is pictured below

What really compliments the steak is the rice. Cuban rice is known to be seasoned with oil, salt, and garlic and it tastes phenomenal at Back to Cuba. In addition, the owner of the restaurant prides himself in the beans. He told us it's his grandma's recipe :) 

Although I love the steak at Back to Cuba, I didn't enjoy the sandwich I ordered nearly as much, which was the Pan con Leeching: roast pork, onion, and mojo sauce.

The bread and the grilled onions were great (I love anywhere that's generous with their onions) but the pork was inconsistent throughout the sandwich. Some of it was too dry while some of it was perfect. However, this place is known for their Cuban sandwiches and the majority of their reviews emphasize the sandwiches, so it may be worth another try. 

##ALWAYS LEAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT

Pictured below is the flan

I don't love flan, so I probably wouldn't get it again but I would get the Arroz con Leche which is their rice pudding. It's not as thick as most rice pudding but it has a more liquidy consistency. It's a lot lighter than most of your typical desserts so it's a great way to finish your meal without feeling terribly full.
