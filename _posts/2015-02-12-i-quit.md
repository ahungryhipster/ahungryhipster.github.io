## Moving Forward

I recently quit my job in Finance because I was unhappy. I wanted more from my job, from myself, and I just wanted more flexibility. 

## Background

I was working on a small team of 6 that supported Portfolio Managers in investing individuals/foundations' assets that were worth over $10M. I was the only female on the team, and the only minority on the team-- double whammy, right? 

## Why

There were a number of factors that contributed to my unhappiness; as I began to realize that a lot of these factors were cultural components that weren't going to change anytime soon, I had to rethink my own career. I was unhappy and I needed to pinpoint why I was unhappy, and what I could do for myself to BE happy.
