Hi baby,

Here's the instructions on how to use this site to edit your blog.

1. Go to _posts
2. Create a "New File"
3. Edit the title (Note: The way this platform reads the title is 
	"YYYY-MM-DD-blah-blah-blah.md"
   It will NOT post the file if there is a space in the title instead of a dash)
4. Edit the body however you see fit.
	-h2 means header 2, makes everything after the "##" bigger, until enter is pressed
    -h3 means header 3, same thing as header 2, but smaller.
    -the next button is Anchor Link (remember myspace?) 
    	Link URL means the url to the link you're trying to redirect people to
        Link Name means the actual words the readers will see
        Title is just want the read will see if they hover over it
    -Inserting Images is tricky. The "selecting one" option doesn't really work, and I can't really help that, it's prose.io's interface. But the drag and drop works wonders. So whereever you want to put any additional pictures in the blog post, just drag and drop the picture from your mac into the editing space.
