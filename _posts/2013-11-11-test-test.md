Hi baby,

Here's the instructions on how to use this site to edit your blog.

1. Go to _posts
2. Create a "New File"
3. Edit the title (Note: The way this platform reads the title is 
	"YYYY-MM-DD-blah-blah-blah.md"
   It will NOT post the file if there is a space in the title instead of a dash)
4. Edit the body however you see fit.
	-h2    
    means header 2, makes everything after the "##" bigger, until enter is pressed
    
    -h3    
    means header 3, same thing as header 2, but smaller
    
    -Anchor Link
    This is the next button right of h3. It's to create links.
    	Link URL means the url to the link you're trying to redirect people to
        Link Name means the actual words the readers will see
        Title is just want the read will see if they hover over it
    
    -Inserting Images      
    is tricky. The "selecting one" option doesn't really work, and I can't really help that, it's prose.io's interface. But the drag and drop works wonders. So whereever you want to put any additional pictures in the blog post, just drag and drop the picture from your mac into the editing space. Should look something like this:
   ![image_name.jpg](/images/image_name.jpg) 
and it's alright if the name in the brackets [ ] are empty like this, as long as the parenthesis is filled correctly:
   ![](/images/image_name.jpg)
   
	-Bold 
    is simply select the words you want bold, it'll add ** around them, denoting it's bold
    
    -Italicize 
    is the same thing as bold, but with _ markings
    
    -Block Quote 
    My favorite one. It add's a > to whatever you want block quoted, and it looks really cool
    
    -Bullet Points
    Adds - to each item, denoting a bullet point
    
    -Numbered Items
    Clicking it gives you 3 automated numbered items, but after that you'll have to manually do it
    
	-Misc
	If you want to use either ##, ###, [], **, _, >, or characters like that, you have to prefix the character using \\, this way the computer will know you want to use the character literally

5. Use the Meta Data option
