So this past Sunday, my boyfriend and I went to eat Otaku South for the second time. Last time we ordered the chicken ramen, Szechuan pork miso ramen, and we wanted to try the hot chicken buns but they ran out. After seeing how bummed we were, they gave us the left over hot chicken for the buns for free.
