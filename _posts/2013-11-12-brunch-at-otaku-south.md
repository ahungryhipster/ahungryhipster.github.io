So this past Sunday, my boyfriend and I went to eat [Otaku South](http://otakusouth.com) for the second time. 

Our first visit we tried the Tsukemono Pickles, Chicken Ramen, and the Pork Szechuan Ramen. Their menu changes regularly so this past Sunday we ordered Okonomiyaki with Kara-Age, Daigaku Imo, and the Tonkotsu Ramen. We're a big fan of ramen in general. Often times, we end up cooking up one of those 35 cent Maruchan Chicken Ramen packs in chicken broth with hot pepper flakes and lots of green onions. Too often. So once we heard about Otaku South, it immediately went on our list of restaurants to try. 

##BITES
I didn't _love_ any of the bites. The Tsukemono Pickles is just a pickled plate, the Daigaku Imo was described to me as similar to french fries with "a taste of the sea," and the Okonomiyaki with Kara-Age is pictured below

If I had to choose a favorite, it would be the Okonomiyaki with Kara-Age, simply because of the Kara-Age. It's basically Japanese fried chicken and was quite tasty.

##RAMEN
I would preference the ramens I've tried so far in this order: Tonkotsu Ramen, Chicken Ramen, and the Pork Szechuan Ramen. However, I would only order the Tonkotsu Ramen again. The pork was excellent and the broth wasn't too heavy. The Chicken Ramen was very light but when I think of ramen, I think of something a little more savory. The Pork Szechuan Ramen didn't have enough broth-- the soup is a significant part of the dish for me, so I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would have.

Otaku South does a great job in terms of presentation. Although it is only a pop up restaurant, it's obvious they put a lot of effort into portraying what they believe ramen is about. Nashville doesn't have a lot of ethnic food but I think Otaku South is trying to break that barrier. I mean, where else can I find ramen that doesn't come from a 35 cent pack anyway?
