So this past Sunday, my boyfriend and I went to eat Otaku South for the second time. 

Our first visit we tried the Tsukemono Pickles, Chicken Ramen, and the Pork Szechuan Ramen. Their menu changes regularly so this past Sunday we ordered Okonomiyaki with Kara-Age, Daigaku Imo, and the Tonkotsu Ramen. We're a big fan of ramen in general. Often times, we end up cooking up one of those 35cent Maruchan Chicken Ramen packs in chicken broth with hot pepper flakes and lots of green onions. So once we heard about Otaku South, it immediately went on our list of restaurants to try. 

##BITES
I didn't __love__ any of the bites. The Tsukemono Pickles is just a pickled plate, the Daigaku Imo was described to me as similar to french fries with "a taste of the sea," and the Okonomiyaki with Kara-Age is pictured below
