Jennifer is a native Nashvillian, currently double majoring in Economics and HOD at Vanderbilt. Growing up in Hermitage, she traveled everyday to Hume-Fogg, and she has held more than 20 different jobs thus far, working for companies from Native to Goldman Sachs. All of her friends know she's a closet hipster, but she's only recently come to terms with it. The unrelenting dedication to color coordination, fierce love for all things local, and an unquenchable need to find the best places to eat, drink, or just hang.
